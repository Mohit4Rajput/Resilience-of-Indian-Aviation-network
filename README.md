# Resilience-of-Indian-Aviation-network

# abstract

Rapid urbanization with intense population growth has increased the need for resilient critical infrastructure systems such as transportation systems. The transportation
system helps in human mobility and the transfer of goods. The Aviation network, one of the critical components of the transportation system, plays a crucial role in the
rapid transfer of people and goods between origin and destination. The recent technological and infrastructure advancements have increased the air-traffic, and aviation
networks have become indispensable for mobility. 

It is necessary to understand the vulnerability and functionality of aviation systems under different hazards, as the perturbation of the system can lead to large-scale cascading failure.
The efficient air-traffic management system under growing traffic has been explored through a complex network approach by characterizing the aviation system as
a dynamic complex network. Previous work on transportation network resilience has focused on understanding the topological characteristics of the road, railway, and
air transportation networks under external perturbation and However, understanding of perturbation of aviation systems under flood hazards is rarely evaluated,
especially in developing nations. 

Here we identify the network characteristics and its evolution under external shocks through random, targeted, and flood hazard-induced
failures. Lastly, we provided the best suitable recovery strategy for restoring the aviation system.
